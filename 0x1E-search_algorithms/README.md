#### Search Algorithms

A search algorithm is a computational method used to find specific information in a dataset. There are several types of search algorithms, each with their own strengths and weaknesses:

1. Linear search: This algorithm examines every item in a list, one by one, until the target item is found. It's simple to implement, but slow when the list is long.
2. Binary search: This algorithm searches a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the list in half, until the target item is found.
